# ART.VISIO Concept

Why modern books, electronic and paper, contain so few pictures?
The maximum that currently allow publishers - an illustration on the cover.

Since publishers have decided to save money on the work of artists, and the 
possibilities of modern algorithms (rendering methods) allow you to create fully 
photorealistic images, why not entrust the work of the computer?
